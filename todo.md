## high pri

- develop the end story. something should happen with the animated ball. probably should just use another shader :D
- room for 2 biomes. but what?
  - playing with room size amplitude?
  - i wished for more shaped, like stalactite, but i don't think can afford the gpu cost
- optimize...
- AUDIO (THIS AFTERNOON!!!)
- play the game FOR REAL to see if there are gameplay to improve in level gen (intersect / etc..)
- quick audio bootstrap

# medium

- bug: the flame map is not properly mapped, see in low Q.
- various rocks. if we can figure out generative unique shapes, it's good for "remembering" position.
- more biomes, more objects that are uniquely positioned.
  - B_WATER
  - B_ROCKY: where there is no wall but you ride on a thin rock. I think the oversee vision can be cool (less fog. any room to INCREASE TRACK_SIZE?)
- end story? might be important, but not too crazy (there is no room for perf...). thinking maybe it becomes blueish and you enter in a nice landscape...

# low

- gamepad support
- polish gameover that should focus on the correct entrance with the cart in sight.
- light object on the front left section of the cart
- (polish wall shape) it's damn too late to think that but the walls should have be just based on a circle XD


## Audio

- bootstrap
- can hear the train pace in background. only louder when it's slower so it's not annoying.
- braking creates the crazy brake sound of train.
- gameover. hitting the rocks hard need to have sound.
- the ending. no more train pace, maybe a zen sound.
- then needs music.
