## Main TODO
- improve map (turn,descent => needs variety to feel more unique & less crazy) / levels / intersect position to have a nice gradual gameplay
- iterate on biomes
- quick audio bootstrap
- topleft light on the cart like in indianajones

## Game
-? gamepad support
-? mobile support
- check windows / IE

## Graphics
- LOW iterate on the end "story". thinking maybe it becomes blueish and you enter in a nice landscape...
- for intersection biome, at extremity, we need to have some wood holding the walls. it's ok if the dead end have it to, kinda adds to the scene..
- HIGH all walls should have small disformation effect.
- under the rail, there should be rocks & a bit everywhere on the ground. probably we could have diff type of rails. indep from biomes?
- HOWTO better lighting?
- are shadows/AO feasible? XD (especially shadow are kinda cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyJCmOOVJto) http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/DynamicOcclusionWithSignedDistanceFields.pdf
- LOW more complex wall shape https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xsd3Rs
- LOW seamless perlin noise plz :D
- MED the cart could have a light in the front, like in Indian Jones
- MED blur / persistence in after effect. might probably add to the gfx.

## Biome/variety ideas

- more some descent again. I like to see the wood structure. (see indiana jones)
- rocky biome, rails on a rocky terrain (no wall) more foggy
- ambients colors
- LOW walls could be "painted". we could have a specific texture that we re-set each chunk gen time that is just drawn on walls? Cube Mapping.
- various visual effect on colors. I'm thinking there could be very dark rooms vs very light. (also imagine crazy room where weird glitch happen, what does it mean for the story tho xD) (we need lighter biome when we reach the end)
- LOW insects? https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mss3zM
- HI rocks & various objects
- HI soom wood holding the roof.
- LOW some clothes https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldlcRf
- HI stalac(t/m)ite.
- HI plants / ivy
- HI mushrooms
- MED water/lava? https://www.shadertoy.com/view/llK3Dy
- MED flame/fire https://www.shadertoy.com/results?query=fire ( https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MdX3zr / https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsSBD1 / https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dXGR4 )
- weird shapes https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MsfGzM , https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4ts3z2
- really basically any object from Indian Jones
- hardcoded track intersection. (reversed / crossed)
- walls should have variety of materials.

## Audio

- bootstrap
- can hear the train pace in background. only louder when it's slower so it's not annoying.
- braking creates the crazy brake sound of train.
- gameover. hitting the rocks hard need to have sound.
- the ending. no more train pace, maybe a zen sound.
- then needs music.
