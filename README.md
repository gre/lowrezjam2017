## MEMO CART



**A PostMortem article will be written soon...**

Finished just in time, this game is the most ambitious game I ever created, made in 2 weeks during [lowrezjam2017](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2017) game jam.

I have worked exactly 97 hours on it as will prove an (accelerated) timelapse video I'm going to submit soon.

The graphics are entirely procedurally generated (no static textures, no "static models"). There is a single fragment shader that render the whole game by raymarching signed distance functions. It was a great challenge to optimize. The UI is made with Canvas2D. there is also some composition work in another shader (some motion blur effect).

The audio effects was made by myself and with some help from @mrspeaker on some biome songs so kudos to him üëç
